# MT-CCL
The supervised multitask learning experiments are conducted on Multi-MNIST, CelebA, NYU-v2 and CityScapes datasets. We follow the setup from MTAN. The datasets could be downloaded from [Multi-MNIST](https://github.com/
shaohua0116/MultiDigitMNIST), [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html), [NYU-v2](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/86nssgwm6hm3vkb/AACrnUQ4GxpdrBbLjb6n-mWNa?dl=0) and [CityScapes](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gaw6vh6qusoyms6/AADwWi0Tp3E3M4B2xzeGlsEna?dl=0). After the datasets are downloaded, please follow the respective run.sh script in each folder. In particular, modify the dataroot variable to the downloaded dataset.
